### Summary
This project aims to develop a Scilab code capable of balancing chemical equations. We focus on the chemical equation for ammonia production, which is crucial in industrial processes, hence the reason for our focus on this specific material. Additionally, we present the development of the algebraic process within Scilab. Finally, we discuss the conclusions we reached after developing this method, highlighting its advantages and limitations.

### Introduction
In industrial processes involving chemical engineers, it is necessary to calculate the stoichiometric coefficients of chemical reactions to minimize losses and enhance process efficiency. These calculations can often become excessively lengthy and complex due to the volume of chemical reactions and the number of reactants and products involved. Therefore, our goal is to reduce this operational burden on engineers by leveraging the computational power of computers to perform successive operations quickly, thus accelerating this process. In other words, the engineer performs the analytical process of the chemical reaction, while the machine, thanks to an algorithm, handles the operational process. But what algorithm can we use to solve these stoichiometric calculations? On what principles or mathematical methods can we base this algorithm?

### Objectives
Our objective is to develop an algorithm capable of performing the operational part of the chemical equation balancing process. We will implement this algorithm in Scilab, as it allows for easy manipulation of matrices. The program we develop will balance chemical equations using the algebraic method, thereby optimizing the process of obtaining an industrial product, in this case, ammonia.

### Discussion
We discuss the advantages and limitations of the applied method for the program. The main advantage of this method is the speed with which it can determine the coefficients associated with each molecule. The equations can be balanced in a few steps by simply copying the reactants and products with their respective values. Naturally, this tool can expedite the balancing process for industrial processes. However, a significant limitation of this method is that it cannot balance equations with fractional coefficients.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, by creating a Scilab code using simple mathematical methods, such as obtaining the coefficient matrix of a system of equations, we can tackle larger problems. These problems may not necessarily require extensive analysis but do require the computational power of a machine. With the correct algorithm, it is possible to optimize the time for industrial processes involving numerous reactants and products.
